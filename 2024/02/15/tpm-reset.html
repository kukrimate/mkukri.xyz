		<p>The title is somewhat click-baity, but also true in a way, this only breaks
dTPMs and the reset attack was known prior, however some people seem to have
believed the misconception that encrypted parameters save such designs.</p>
<p>This research was done in collaboration with a good friend of mine known as
<it>birb</it> on these parts, the full article describing this work is hosted on
his blog: <a href="https://hacky.solutions/blog/2024/02/tpm-attack">link</a></p>

<p>Please note that while the demo above is shown using a modular TPM card,
it is entirely possible to execute the same attack on a soldered TPM too:
<ul>
<li> on some systems it is rather trivial as the LPC bus reset does not reset
  the CPU so it's just a matter of grounding the reset pin on the TPM </li>
<li> on other systems, grounding the reset pin on the TPM would reset the CPU,
  so cutting the reset trace near the TPM is necessary</li>
</ul>
