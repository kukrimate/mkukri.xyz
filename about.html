		<h1> About this site</h1><p>Hi, this is the website of Máté Kukri. I use this as site as a platform to post
about programming, cybersecurity and occasionally other things.</p><h2> About me</h2><p>I was born in Hungary and lived the first 19 years of my life there. I've been
tinkering with computers ever since I had my first PC in 2010. Playing games and
breaking Windows got boring after a while, and I started learning programming in
2012. After finishing secondary school in 2019 I moved to the United Kingdom to
study Computing Science at the University of Glasgow.</p><p>I am a comittee member of the <a href="https://gusecurity.github.io">GUSEC</a>
(Glasgow University Security Society). We are a student run society.
Our goal is getting more people interested in cybersecurity at the
university and learning more about the topic together.</p><h2> Contact</h2><ul><li> GitHub profile: <a href="https://github.com/kukrimate">Go</a></li><li> HackTheBox profile: <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/profile/244124">Go</a></li><li> Contact me by e-mail: <b id='s'></b> <a onclick="f();">Show</a>
